- what language do i write this in
    - C - familiar, but messy
    - Python - easy, but slow, python also doesn't like multiprocessing which will be necessary
    - C# - done it before, OOP, but not portable to linux - not an option
    - Java - not familiar, supposed to work like C#, but painful to build 
    - C++ - not my most familiar, but works like c with objects

    Conclusion - C++
        - will improve my knowledge of the language
        - is portable to windows and linux (and possibly even mac)
        - can be built easily enough
        - has class capabilities

    Second conclusion - Java
        - get to learn another language
        - portable
        - class features + interfacing and other OOP
        - the build will be something to suffer through

- Where do i want to run this?
    - Raspberry Pi
    - AWS instance
    - Windows machine if bored
    ==Linux capabilities remove C# as an option==
